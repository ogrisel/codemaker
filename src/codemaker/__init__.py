"""Neural nets-based utility to build low dimensional codes or/and sparse codes

- low dimensional projections are typically used for semantic mapping and
visualization of high dim vector data while preserving nearest neighboors

- sparse codes are typically used for scalable semantic indexing of high
dimensional vectors such as the term frequency vectors of documents
